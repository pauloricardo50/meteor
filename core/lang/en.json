This calculation allows lenders to evaluate if they consider that you will be able to afford the costs of the mortgage loan you are applying for, even in case of a higher interest rates increase. Indeed, interest rates are very low today. But, in order to avoid an economic crisis in case of a significant increase of interest rates, Banks have the duty to take into account a possible increase of interest rates.{vertical Space}This is why the theoretical interest rate imposed by FINMA is often calculated at a rate of 5%. At this rate you have to take into account a amortization and expenses of maintenance that are equally theoretical.",
